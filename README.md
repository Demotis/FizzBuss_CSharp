My Answer to the ago old question "Do we Fizz or do we Buzz"

So I have recently been in the market for a new job, and how have things changed. At one time the guys would look at your resume, call up your references and hire you based on your word. Now they want you to do these stupid whiteboard problems. I was asked to write a program that "Fizz"ed or "Buzz"ed. I gave this as an answer and the Lead Programer thought it was "Different". Not sure what different meant to him, but I came home after and did a little searching and found some very complex answers to the question. I also found, thanks to Google, that there are a ton of people getting asked this question.

Well, here is my answer. I hope you enjoy.
